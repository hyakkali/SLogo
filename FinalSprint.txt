Additional views that show:

current state of a turtle (i.e., its ID, position, heading) and its pen (i.e., up/down, color, thickness) updated while the
code is running. Feel free to include any other values you feel would be usefully associated with either.
        Using the setright click action event and  a context menu with MenuItems


palettes of images and colors with their associates numeric values that can be referred to within new SLogo commands
 (i.e., it should be clear which images/colors are associated with which numbers so the SLogo language can refer to
  them in code). At the start, there should be a default set of values assigned to numbers to choose from.


Allow users to directly manipulate elements within the views so that are not simply displays:



click to execute commands from the history or user-defined commands (provide a means to enter needed parameters)


click to edit the value of user-defined variables


click to toggle which turtles are currently active (active turtles should be graphically distinct from inactive ones)


provide a way to move the current turtle(s) graphically (at least FD, BK, LT, and RT by a fixed amount)


provide a way to change the pen's current properties graphically (up/down, thickness, etc.)
