SLogo Refactoring Discussion ddp19, aak29, hy115, cmm134
=====
* The static code tool from SonarQube gave us pretty bad reviews - lucky, we realized everything in there was a relatively easy fix. We can refactor long methods to contain other shorter ones, add new Javadocs comments to support further documentation, and remove "magic constants" in the frontend.
* We talked at length about removing the `Controller` dependencies throughout the code. Although the purpose of the controller is solely to facilitate communication between the frontend and the backend, we pass it through our code far too often and it appears as an instance in a lot of classes. However, we plan on refactoring such that it only appears as a parameter in classes where it is needed - this is how all `Command` objects are structured. Then, we will have the `parseText()` method in the backend return a `Stack` of commands instead of a `double` as it currently does. The front end will then be able to execute its own commands, reducing dependencies. 
* The thing giving us the most trouble is the _tell_ command - we cannot figure out how to get commands to act on multiple turtles separately. When lists of commands [separated by brackets] are input, they are put into new `CommandList` objects but they are all executed at once. This creates an issue with how the commands are executed.
